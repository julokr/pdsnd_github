### Project Title
Exploring the Bikeshare Data

### Description
This project was aimed at exploring randomly selected data related to bikeshare systems for the first six months of 2017 for 
three major cities in the United States:
- Chicago
- New York city
- Washington 

Bicycle-sharing systems allow users to rent bicycles on a very short-term basis for a price. This allows people to borrow a bike from point A and return it at 
point B, though they can also return it to the same location if they'd like to just go for a ride. Regardless, each bike can serve several users per day.

The project involved writing a python script (bikeshare_2.py) that computes a variety of descriptive statistics about bike sharing in three major cities to 
provide the following information:

1. **Popular times of travel** (i.e., occurs most often in the start time)
- most common month
- most common day of week
- most common hour of day

2. **Popular stations and trip**
- most common start station
- most common end station
- most common trip from start to end (i.e., most frequent combination of start station and end station)

3. **Trip duration**
- total travel time
- average travel time

4. **User info**
- counts of each user type
- counts of each gender (only available for NYC and Chicago)
- earliest, most recent, most common year of birth (only available for NYC and Chicago)
